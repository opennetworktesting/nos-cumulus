# Open Network Testing Consortium - NOS configuration for Cumulus Linux

[Open Network Testing Consortium](https://www.iol.unh.edu/testing/open-networking/ocp) works
in concert with Open Compute Project's [Networking Working Group](http://www.opencompute.org/wiki/Networking)
to provide interop and conformance testing for Open Networking products.

This repo contains configuration files required by the [test plan](http://www.opencompute.org/wiki/Networking/SpecsAndDesigns#Pluggable_Transceiver_and_Host_Compliance_and_Interopability_Test_Plan) using Cumulus Linux 2.5.x.
